#Overview

- This is an AI driven development project. It is critical that you always follow the instructions in this file to allow for ease of access to AI coding tools picking up tasks so they can easily become oriented in the project.  As you are building the app, maintain a documentation infrastructure list below to map out the dependencies and the where/what is contained in each directory.
# Documentation Requirements

- **AI_Instructions.md**: Maintain a top-level file describing app architecture, all services, how the app works, and deployment process
- **Directory READMEs**: Every directory must have a README.md explaining its purpose and how it interacts with the rest of the app
- **File Documentation**: All significant files should have detailed comments or accompanying documentation explaining their role and interactions
- **Live Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation files whenever making changes to the codebase
